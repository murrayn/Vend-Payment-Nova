Revision history for Perl extension Vend::Payment::Nova.

01-13-2009 - Version 1.02
    - Joseph Montanez reports that Nova might (rarely) return 'APPROVAL' instead of 'APPROVED'.
03-17-2011 - Version 1.03
    - added 'use strict;' -- an oversight, but didn't require any further changes. :-)
    - some formatting changes, and made a DEBUG constant
    - added VERSION to Makefile.PL
