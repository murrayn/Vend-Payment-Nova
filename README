Vend-Payment-Nova
==============================

The Vend::Payment::Nova module implements the nova() routine for using
Nova IC payment services with Interchange. It is compatible on a call level
with the other Interchange payment modules -- in theory (and even usually in
practice) you could switch from CyberCash to Nova with a few configuration
file changes.

To enable this module, place this directive in C<interchange.cfg>:

    Require module Vend::Payment::Nova

This I<must> be in interchange.cfg or a file included from it.

NOTE: Make sure CreditCardAuto is off (default in Interchange demos).

The mode can be named anything, but the C<gateway> parameter must be set
to C<nova>. To make it the default payment gateway for all credit
card transactions in a specific catalog, you can set in C<catalog.cfg>:

    Variable   MV_PAYMENT_MODE  nova

It uses several of the standard settings from Interchange payment. Any time
we speak of a setting, it is obtained either first from the tag/call options,
then from an Interchange order Route named for the mode, then finally a
default global payment variable, For example, the C<id> parameter would
be specified by:

    [charge mode=nova merhcant_id=YourMerchantID]

or

    Route nova merhcant_id YourMerchantID

or with only Nova as a payment provider

    Variable MV_PAYMENT_ID     YourMerchantID

A fully valid catalog.cfg entry to work with the standard demo would be:

    Variable MV_PAYMENT_MODE      nova
    Variable MV_PAYMENT_MERCHANT_ID  YourMerchantID 
    Variable MV_PAYMENT_USER_ID      YourUserID
    Variable MV_PAYMENT_PIN          YourUserPIN
